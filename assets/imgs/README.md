# Light Bulb Icons Required

The dark mode toggle requires two PNG images:

## Required Files

1. **lightbulb-off.png**
   - Represents an unlit/off light bulb
   - Shows in light mode
   - Indicates clicking will enable dark mode
   - Recommended size: 24x24 pixels or larger (will be scaled to 24x24)

2. **lightbulb-on.png**
   - Represents a lit/on light bulb
   - Shows in dark mode
   - Indicates clicking will enable light mode
   - Recommended size: 24x24 pixels or larger (will be scaled to 24x24)

## Adding the Images

Place both PNG files in this directory (`assets/imgs/`):
- `assets/imgs/lightbulb-off.png`
- `assets/imgs/lightbulb-on.png`

## Tips

- Use transparent backgrounds for best results
- Keep designs simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast against both light and dark backgrounds
- SVG files can be converted to PNG using online tools
