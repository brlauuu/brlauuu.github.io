![Well hello there!](assets/imgs/KP7C1937_Selected.jpg "Itsa me")

Hello there! My name is Đorđe and I come from a small town of Sombor, at the North of Serbia. Over time, I've been spending time on a wide specter of useful and useless projects and you can check them out on my [LinkedIn profile](linkedin.com/in/dorderelic/) and on my [GitHub page](github.com/brlauuu). I use this generous hosting provided by GitHub to share some stories from personal and professional life that I think would be useful for other people to read. If you like what you read and want to follow up on some topics, feel free to drop me a line on Twitter [@brlauuu](twitter.com/brlauuu).

Credits to the site setup. I took this [minima template for github-pages](https://github.com/jsanz/gh-pages-minima-starter) over from [Jorge Sanz](https://github.com/jsanz/). I applied minor updates to the template. For full description and instruction, check out [documentation for `minima theme`](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/2.5-stable).
